# OpenOmni

Documentation and 2 programs for decoding omnipod communications for RTLSDR and RFCAT devices. 

[Join the Slack channel](https://omniaps.slack.com/) to discuss this work.

All the found messages can be found in the documentation on the [wiki](https://github.com/openaps/openomni/wiki)  

## Current Status

We have figured out the [RF modulation](https://github.com/openaps/openomni/wiki/RF-Modulation) and [packet/message encoding](https://github.com/openaps/openomni/wiki). We are now working on decoding the meaning of the bytes in the body for each of the [Message Types](https://github.com/openaps/openomni/wiki/Message-Types).

Device drivers for [Rileylink](https://getrileylink.org/) are currently being developped with use of this documentation:
1. [Rileylink branch Omnikit](https://github.com/ps2/rileylink_ios/tree/dev) for using the pump with [Loop](https://github.com/LoopKit/Loop)
2. [RileylinkAAPS branch dev_omnikit](https://github.com/ktomy/RileyLinkAAPS) for using the pump with [AndoidAPS](https://github.com/MilosKozak/AndroidAPS)

## Areas to focus on

There are two ways we could use your help.
  1. Capture data from different pods and commands using omni_listen_rfcat. If you can document what was being done with the PDM while the packets were recorded, that would be a plus, but raw data can be helpful too.  Submit these as new wiki pages and add your new page to the [Packet Captures](https://github.com/openaps/openomni/wiki/Packet-Captures) page.
  2. Start decoding fields for [individual commands](https://github.com/openaps/openomni/wiki/Message-Types). A good way to start doing this is to repeatedly perform a certain type of action on the PDM tweaking *1* thing each time, and inspecting the generated packets to see which bytes differ.

## What you'll need

There  are 2 ways you can build a radio capture and parsing setup:

1. RFCAT Omni

This was the first python based capture program, which parsed the data as raw or as txt.
This needs a [compatible RF Cat USB stick](https://int3.cc/products/rfcat) and has done a great job in capturing, but was expensive because you will need to flash firmware onto it using a [CC-Debugger](https://store.ti.com/CC-DEBUGGER-Debugger-and-Programmer-for-RF-System-on-Chips-P1627.aspx) and we later discovered it was missing some packages.

2. RTL-SDR Omni

This program was later developped to capture the pure wav files in C which can parsed directly. It can also parse the raw txt data of the RFCAT above. This solution uses an [inexpensive RTL-SDR USB stick with an antenna](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/buy-rtl-sdr-dvb-t-dongles) (really needed to get a good recording) as cheaper hardware solution.
